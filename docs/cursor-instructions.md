# Solana Trading Simulator Server - Technical Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical specifications for a standalone Solana Trading Simulator Server designed to host a competition that involves simulated trading. The server will allow multiple teams to connect via unique API keys, submit trade requests, and keep track of individual team performances.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Purpose

The Solana Trading Simulator Server will provide a controlled environment for teams to practice and compete in simulated trading on the Solana blockchain without risking real assets. This will allow participants to:

- Execute trades using virtual balances
- Track performance over time
- Compare results with other participants
- Learn about Solana token trading in a safe environment

### 2.2 Key Features

- Team registration and API key management
- Token price simulation using real market data
- Trade execution with configurable parameters
- Balance and portfolio tracking
- Performance analytics and leaderboards
- Administrative dashboard for competition management

### 2.3 Reference Implementation

A reference implementation of the core trading functionality can be found in the `plugin-simulator-solana-example` directory. This implementation was originally created as a plugin for a separate application and should be used as guidance rather than directly integrated.

#### 2.3.1 Reference Architecture

The example implementation includes:

- **Price Tracking**: Multi-provider approach for fetching token prices (Jupiter, Raydium, Serum, and Solana)
- **Balance Management**: Simple balance tracking for different tokens
- **Trade Simulation**: Basic trade execution with price-based calculations
- **API Actions**: Example endpoints for executing trades and fetching data

#### 2.3.2 Adaptation Notes

When using the reference implementation:

- The core trading simulation logic in `services/TradeSimulator.ts` can be largely reused
- The price tracking mechanism in `services/PriceTracker.ts` with multiple providers is a robust approach to adopt
- The balance management in `services/BalanceManager.ts` provides a foundation but needs to be extended for multi-team support
- The API interface in `actions/` directory needs to be redesigned for a standalone server architecture
- The existing implementation lacks competition management features which need to be built from scratch
- Authentication and authorization need significant enhancement for the multi-team server model

Developers should use the reference implementation to understand the core trading mechanics while building a new standalone application that fulfills all the requirements in this specification.

## 11. Trading Rules and Constraints

- Trading is only allowed for tokens with valid price data

- All teams start with identical token balances (10 SOL, 1000 USDC, 1000 USDT)
- Minimum trade amount: 0.000001 tokens
- Maximum single trade: 25% of team's total portfolio value
- No shorting allowed (trades limited to available balance)
- Rate limiting as defined in section 3.2.2
- Teams can only trade during active competition periods
- Slippage is applied to all trades according to the formula in section 3.2.3
- Transaction fees are not simulated in the MVP

## 12. Conclusion

This technical specification outlines the architecture and implementation plan for the Solana Trading Simulator Server. The document will guide the development team in building a robust, scalable platform that can support a trading competition with multiple teams accessing the system via API keys.
